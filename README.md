# miniScript (we call it YSL in yalda, it's birthplace)
Trying to write a `DSL` which converts the provided code to old honoured `JQuery`. we are using it inside our `formbuilder`.
after the idea was baked enough, using current ai technology we started it from scratch step by step used Antlr 4.13.2 as parser engine.
currently the documentation can be found nowhere. 
issues are  welcome, we also welcome unit tests(new or updated).


### More history, the story or user story
we had been used to write a `formgenerator` (new era :`formbuilder`) every year, so decided to write another one which is the last.
we are adding logic to it to be more usable, graphic is also important.




current state of unit tests
