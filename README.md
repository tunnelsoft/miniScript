# miniScript 

miniScript is a lightweight scripting language designed for simplicity and ease of use. 
currently its main usecase is converting provided code to old honoured `JQuery`.

It was a hobby project aimed at creating a `DSL` that is used in writing fast and reliable JQuery code. we are using it inside our `formbuilder`. 

after the idea was baked enough, using current ai technology we started it from scratch step by step and used Antlr 4.13.2 as parser engine.

currently the documentation can be found nowhere.

issues are  welcome, we also like unit tests(new or updated) to cover more use cases.

we call it YSL(Yalda Scripting Language) in yalda, her birthplace.

## Features

*   Simple syntax inspired by unpopular `Js`!, a subset of js is implemented
*   Support for variables, control structures, functions, and more
*   Built-in support for common data structures like arrays
*   Easy-to-use syntax for working with APIs

## Goals

*   Create a language that's easy to learn and use, even for beginners
*   Provide a simple and intuitive syntax for common programming tasks like calling apis and validation
*   Build a community around the language to support its growth and development
*   Develop an evaluator to evaluate the result of expressions.

## Usage

To be written

### More history
we had been used to write a `formgenerator` (new era :`formbuilder`) and `processbuilder` every year, so decided to write another one which is the last.
we are adding logic to both of them to be more usable and understandable, graphic is also important.


current state of unit tests

All Passed: :)
